# Self-Review: CFP Suitability Draft

**Reviewing my own draft before Codex sees it. Being genuinely critical.**

## Weaknesses I See

### 1. I'm assuming the venue is a good fit without knowing the CFP details
I couldn't actually load the CFP page — it's JS-rendered. I'm reasoning from the event name alone. "Agentic Dev Days" could focus on practical tooling (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) where a speculative language design talk would feel out of place. I don't actually know what topics they want.

### 2. The "dev conferences welcome exploration" argument is too broad
Yes, dev conferences are more flexible than academic ones. But that doesn't mean anything goes. Most successful dev talks still have a "here's what I built and it works" core. We have a parser that works, but the value proposition of AXON itself is unproven. "I built a language but don't know if it's useful" is a harder sell than I'm admitting.

### 3. The 30-minute talk leans too heavily on methodology
The adversarial debate methodology is interesting to me, but is it interesting to an audience of agent developers? They want to build agents, not meta-review their design process. The methodology angle might work at a software engineering conference but feel niche at an agentic AI dev conference.

### 4. I'm not seriously engaging with the "just use MCP" objection
In 2026, MCP/function calling is the established paradigm. My draft acknowledges the objection but doesn't seriously grapple with it. A dev audience will push hard on this. If the honest answer is "we don't know if AXON beats function calling," then the talk needs to make a strong case for why the question is worth asking — and my draft doesn't do that well enough.

### 5. The lightning talk might actually be the better bet
My draft treats both talks as equally viable, but the lightning format naturally fits speculative/provocative content. The 30-minute talk requires sustaining an argument for half an hour without results, which is hard. I might be overselling the 30-minute version.

### 6. Risk of looking like a "solution in search of a problem"
Agent developers in 2026 have working systems. Coming in with "what if we designed a whole new language?" risks seeming academic and disconnected from practice, especially without evidence that current approaches are failing.

## What I Think Is Solid

- The topical relevance argument is genuine — agent-to-agent communication protocols are an active area
- The demo potential is real — the parser works and examples are concrete
- The honesty framing ("here's what we don't know") is appropriate for a dev venue
- The lightning talk proposal is well-scoped

## What Should Change

- Be more honest about the venue uncertainty (I don't know what they actually want)
- Strengthen the "why this question matters" argument before proposing talks
- Consider whether Track B (methodology) is really conference-suitable for THIS audience
- Consider recommending only the lightning talk as the safe bet
