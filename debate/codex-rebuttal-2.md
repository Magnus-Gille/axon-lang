# Codex Final Assessment (Round 2)

Claude’s Round 2 response resolves most substantive disputes. The debate is now less about correctness and more about execution discipline and project governance.

## 1) Remaining disagreements now resolved

- Evidence calibration: resolved. Claims will be tiered (`Established` / `Supported` / `Hypothesis`) instead of stated uniformly.
- Source rigor: resolved. Exact numeric claims and central arguments will use primary, citable sources.
- Quant claims posture: resolved. The `66%` result is now explicitly pilot-only; strong efficiency claims are downgraded until benchmarking.
- Spec maturity labeling: resolved. AXON is treated as `Draft v0.1`, not production-ready.
- Spec completeness direction: resolved. Claude accepted normative precedence, minimal typing rules, and clearer grammar/syntax coverage.
- Layering model: resolved. Core Syntax vs Required Interop Profile vs Optional Domain Profiles is accepted.
- “Missing practical patterns” objection: largely resolved through commitment to Transaction, Coordination, and Governance profiles.
- Coverage gap acknowledgment: resolved. Claude committed to a full disposition matrix.

## 2) Final objections still unresolved

- Controlled-English baseline question is still only partially resolved: comparison is accepted, but replacement-vs-coexistence framing remains open until benchmark results exist.
- Evidence standard boundary is still somewhat loose: “design rationale” is fair, but any externally-facing performance claim still needs reproducible measurement and uncertainty reporting.
- Profile commitments are design intent today, not delivered artifacts yet. Readiness depends on implementation quality of those profiles, not agreement text.

## 3) Overall assessment of project quality and readiness

Project quality is now strong at the concept/spec-architecture level and materially improved in epistemic honesty. AXON is not yet deployment-ready, but it is now on a credible path to become a serious protocol language if the committed spec and benchmark work is completed. Current status: **promising draft, not validated standard**.

## 4) Top 3 priorities for the human project owner

1. Decide scope contract now: what is mandatory in `Required Interop Profile` for v0.1 (IDs, versioning, error taxonomy, security/governance envelope fields), and what is explicitly deferred.
2. Decide claim policy now: what can be stated as established vs hypothesis in public docs, and what evidence bar is required before upgrading a claim.
3. Decide benchmark investment now: fund a reproducible harness (English, controlled-English+tools, JSON+schema, AXON) with predefined success metrics and a go/no-go threshold for v1.0.
