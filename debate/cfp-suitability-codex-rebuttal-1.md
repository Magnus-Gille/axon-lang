# Round 2 Rebuttal: CFP Suitability

Claude made real progress. Several concessions are genuine and adequate, but the response still leaves a decision-quality gap on what evidence is sufficient for anything beyond a lightning slot.

## Concessions That Are Genuine and Adequate

These are substantive, not cosmetic:
- C1 (30-minute structure is brittle): accepted clearly and correctly. This resolves the prior overconfidence in the original structure.
- C2 (Track B was over-projected for this venue): accepted with the right audience correction. Treating methodology as support, not center, is the right adjustment.
- C3 (5-minute lightning was overloaded): accepted with concrete scope reduction.
- C4 (perception risk is strategic, not just presentational): accepted and correctly reframed as long-term downside.

Net: these concessions fix the biggest rhetorical inflation in the original draft.

## Valid Defenses vs Dodges

### Valid defenses
- D1 (lightning can be suitable without validation): valid. A dev lightning slot can legitimately present a concrete prototype plus open questions.
- D2 (feedback upside is materially valuable): valid. Practitioner correction can directly improve experiment design.
- PC2 (MCP/function-calling distinction): valid at concept level. AXON can target a different semantic layer.

### Where the response still dodges
- PC1 (venue-fit uncertainty): still unresolved operationally. "Likely relevant" is not a substitute for confirming actual CFP criteria.
- 30-minute conditional defense remains soft: "may be achievable" is not a threshold. You still need a hard go/no-go rule.
- Proposed cheap benchmark (token-count experiment) is being treated as potential 30-minute grounding. That does not meet the burden by itself; token compression is not protocol utility.

## New Issues Introduced

1. Evidence-quality drift risk: the response implicitly elevates a low-cost token metric as enough to support a longer talk. That can worsen the "DSL for syntax" perception.
2. Decision ambiguity risk: you now have a conditional 30-minute position but no explicit minimum evidence bar (metric types, baselines, success/failure criteria).
3. Diligence gap persists: CFP scope confirmation is still missing while making format-strategy decisions.

## Final Verdict

### (a) Should they submit at all?
Yes. They should submit.

### (b) Which format?
Submit **lightning only** for now.
- 30-minute submission should happen only if at least one executed benchmark demonstrates practical value beyond token count (for example, semantic correctness/failure handling against a strong JSON/MCP baseline).

### (c) Single most important thing to get right in the proposal
The proposal must **front-load epistemic honesty with a falsifiable value claim**:
- "This is a protocol hypothesis with a working prototype and explicit test plan," not "a better agent standard."
- If that line is blurry, the proposal will be read as premature DSL evangelism and rejected on credibility.
