# Self-Review: CFP Proposal Draft

## What Works
- Title is a hook — "What Happens When You Make Claude and Codex Critique Each Other's Work" creates curiosity
- Abstract leads with the technique, not the project
- Evidence is scoped honestly as pilot data
- Takeaways are concrete and actionable
- "This talk is not about the specific project" line pre-empts the biggest risk

## Where I'm Worried

### 1. The title might be too cute
"What Happens When You Make Claude and Codex Critique Each Other's Work" — is this clickbait? A CFP reviewer might read this as gimmicky. Conference reviewers see hundreds of "What Happens When..." titles. It might not signal substance.

### 2. The abstract buries the lede
The abstract opens with a rhetorical question, then describes the protocol, then gets to results. A reviewer scanning 50 abstracts might not get to "12 confirmed bugs" before moving on. The most compelling fact (concrete bugs found) should be earlier.

### 3. "~85% resolved" is meaningless without context
85% resolution rate sounds good, but resolved how? By fixing the code? By the author conceding? By agreeing to disagree? This number adds noise without explanation.

### 4. No clear "why now?" signal
The abstract doesn't explain why this matters in 2026 specifically. Agent development is maturing — reliability techniques are increasingly important. That context is missing.

### 5. The description section is too long for a lightning talk CFP
Lightning talk proposals are usually short — reviewers don't expect 4 paragraphs of description. This reads more like a 30-minute talk proposal. Should be tighter.

### 6. Speaker bio is empty
Obviously placeholder, but the bio matters for acceptance. Reviewers want to know: has this person given talks before? Are they credible on this topic?

### 7. "Why This Fits" section might not be needed
Some CFPs have a dedicated field for this; others don't. Including it could look like over-justifying. But it also makes the relevance explicit. Depends on the form.

### 8. The format note about "no slides-only" is oddly specific
Saying "includes annotated walkthrough" is fine. Saying "no slides-only" sounds defensive, like I'm pre-empting a complaint nobody made.
