# Self-Review: Methodology Talk Draft

## Where I Might Be Wrong

### 1. I'm overcorrecting from the last debate
The previous debate concluded Track B was "over-projected for this audience." Now I'm arguing it's actually the stronger submission. Am I flip-flopping because the user asked, or because it genuinely is better? I need to be honest: the user asked me to consider it, so I might be arguing it more enthusiastically than the evidence supports.

### 2. "Immediately actionable" is overstated
I claim every attendee can try this Monday morning. But setting up a structured Codex CLI pipeline with multi-round debate protocols isn't trivial. The *idea* is easy to grasp. The *execution* requires tooling, prompt engineering, and a structured workflow. I'm confusing "easy to understand" with "easy to adopt."

### 3. The results are real but small
12 bugs and 6 missing features sounds good, but it's from ONE project by ONE person. n=1. The resolution rate (85%) is interesting but not benchmarked against anything. We don't know if casual code review by a human would find the same or more.

### 4. The 30-minute version might still be thin
Five case-study sections in a 30-minute talk is ambitious. Each gets 5 minutes. That's enough for surface-level "here's what happened" but not enough for deep insight. It might feel like a parade of anecdotes rather than a rigorous methodology talk.

### 5. The "agentic" framing might be a stretch
Using two AI models for code review is arguably just "tool use," not "agentic AI." The conference audience might have a specific definition of "agentic" (autonomous task completion, tool use, planning) that doesn't include "structured debate between models." This could feel off-topic.

## What I Think Holds Up
- The novelty is genuine — I haven't seen talks about structured cross-model adversarial review
- The demo potential is real and more engaging than parser demos
- The "take this home" value is higher than an unvalidated language design
- Having actual outcomes (bugs found, features identified) is stronger than AXON's zero-validation position
