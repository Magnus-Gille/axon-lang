You are scoring an agent-to-agent communication message for information completeness.

A model was given this task:
{task_instruction}

The model produced the following output:
---
{output}
---

Score whether each required element is PRESENT, ABSENT, or INCORRECT in the output above.

REQUIRED ELEMENTS:
{element_checklist}

For each element, respond with EXACTLY one line in this format:
{element_id}. PRESENT — brief justification
{element_id}. ABSENT — what is missing
{element_id}. INCORRECT — what is wrong

Rules:
- Score PRESENT if the element is expressed accurately, regardless of formatting or syntax.
- Score ABSENT if the element is not expressed at all.
- Score INCORRECT if the element is expressed but with the wrong value (e.g., wrong number, wrong agent).
- For identity elements: any name or identifier for the agent counts as PRESENT.
- For content-facts without specified values: any concrete value counts as PRESENT.
- Score every element. Do not skip any. Do not add commentary beyond the scoring lines.
